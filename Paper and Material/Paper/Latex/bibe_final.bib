Note that, because the example references were taken from actual IEEE
publications, these examples do not always contain the full amount
of information that may be desirable (for use with other BibTeX styles).
In particular, full names (not abbreviated with initials) should be
entered whenever possible as some (non-IEEE) bibliography styles use
full names. IEEEtran.bst will automatically abbreviate when it encounters
full names.


The three most common and typical types of references used in
IEEE publications:

an article in a journal
Note the use of the IEEE_J_EDL string, defined in the IEEEabrv.bib file,
for the journal name. IEEEtran.bst defines the BibTeX standard three
letter month codes per IEEE style.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices",
page 996, reference #16.
@article{IEEEexample:article_typical,
  author        = "S. Zhang and C. Zhu and J. K. O. Sin and P. K. T. Mok",

}


journal article using et al.
The (five) authors are actually: F. Delorme, S. Slempkes, G. Alibert,
B. Rose, J. Brandon
The month (July) was not given here.
From the September 1998 issue of "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in
Communications", page 1257, reference #28.

a paper in a conference proceedings
"conference" can be used as an alias for "inproceedings"
From the June 2002 issue of "Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems",
page 205, reference #16.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:conf_typical,
  author        = "R. K. Gupta and S. D. Senturia",

Other examples

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits
or longer into groups of three with small spaces between them. Page ranges
can be separated via either "-" or "--", IEEEtran.bst will automatically
convert the separator dash(es) to "--".
Authors and/or IEEE do not always provide/use the journal number, but it
was used in this case. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore journal
numbers if desired.
From the August 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1039, reference #11.
@article{IEEEexample:articlelargepages,

  pages         = "1047-1053"
}


journal article to be published as a misc entry type
date information like month and year is optional
However, the article form like that below may be a better approach.
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in
Communication", page 725, reference #3.
@misc{IEEEexample:TBPmisc,
  author        = "M. Coates and A. Hero and R. Nowak and B. Yu",

  month         = may,
  year          = "2002",
  note          = "to be published"
}


journal article to be published as an article entry type
year is required, so if absent, use the year field to hold
the "submitted for publication" in order to avoid a warning for
the missing year field.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #21.
@article{IEEEexample:TBParticle,
  author        = "N. Kahale and R. Urbanke",

                   Concatenated Codes",
  journal       = IEEE_J_IT,
  year          = "submitted for publication"
}



conference paper with an address and days. Some journals capitalize the
letters in "Globecom", this one did not.
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Communications",
page 697, reference #12.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:confwithadddays,
  author        = "M. S. Yee and L. Hanzo",

  year          = "1999",
  pages         = "2183-2187"

conference paper with volume number. A conference proceedings with a vol
number is a little uncommon, note that the vol number is placed
before the address in the formatted bibliography entry
From the April 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 181, reference #26.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:confwithvolume,
  author        = "M. Yajnik and S. B. Moon and J. Kurose and D. Towsley",

  month         = mar,
  year          = "1999",
  pages         = "345-352"
}


conference paper with a paper number, the type field can be used to
override the word "paper", e.g., type = "postdeadline paper". A type
can be given even without a paper  field.
Also, IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore paper numbers and types.
From the May 2002 issue of "Journal of Lightwave Technology",
page 807, reference #4.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:confwithpaper,
  author        = "M. Wegmuller and J. P. von der Weid and P. Oberson

  paper         = "11.3.4",

conference paper with a postdeadline type paper, the paper field is
optional.

page 1087, reference #12.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:confwithpapertype,
  author        = "B. Mikkelsen and G. Raybon and R.-J. Essiambre and

  paper         = "2-3",
  type          = "postdeadline paper",
  pages         = "28-29"
}


presented at a conference
intype overrides the default "in" and causes the booktitle not to be
emphasized (rendered in italics).
From the February 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 163, reference #6.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:presentedatconf,
  author        = "S. G. Finn and M. M{\'e}dard and R. A. Barry",

  intype        = "presented at the",
  booktitle     = "Proc. Int. Conf. Commun.",
  year          = "1997"
}



an unpublished work
for unpublished types, the note field is required. IEEE usually
just uses the word "unpublished" for the note.
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 391, reference #16.
@unpublished{IEEEexample:unpublished,
  author        = "T. J. Ott and N. Aggarwal",
  title         = "{TCP} over {ATM}: {ABR} or {UBR}",
  note          = "Unpublished"
}




An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
